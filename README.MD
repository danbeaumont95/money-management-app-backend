# Dans Money backend

## Introduction

This is the backend api to my Python/TypeScript-React money management app

Tech stack used: 
* Python
* FastAPI
* MongoDB
* PyMongo
* Plaid
* a few more small packages

&nbsp;

The aim of this app was to create a money management app not just for myself, but to anyone else who doesnt want to pay companies like Monzo, Revolut for a web app that manages all of their UK bank account finances all in one place.
